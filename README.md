Code to make [zoomable maps of word2vec models](http://benschmidt.org/word2vec_map/) and other low-dimensional views of long, high-dimensional data. The 'tsne' folder is a lightly modified version of https://github.com/lvdmaaten/bhtsne; the 'webpage' folder borrows from some of Mike Bostock's pan+zoom gists. (http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3892919) and Elijah Meeks canvas + svg (http://bl.ocks.org/emeeks/306e64e0d687a4374bcd). It's under the GPL, I guess, as a result.
