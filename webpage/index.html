<h3>Four and half million books</h3>

There are about four and a half million public domain books in the Hathi Trust. This
  is a zoomable visualization that lets you explore all of them. Click
  on any point to read the book in Hathi; zoom in to see more books in
  a region. Books are arranged in space using the LargeVis algorithm
  on their full-text; no metadata was consulted in arranging the library.
<br>
There are many clusters here besides the language ones that show up at
  the macro level. For instance, if you zoom in on the
  lower left tail of the English language books (just to the Northwest
  of the big French blob), you'll find a bunch of Shakespeare; zoom in
  even more, and you'll see that each of the Shakespeare plays
  occupies its own cluster.

  <br>
  There's no search yet for individual books. That's a complicated
  problem that would require using the Hathi API.
